## Latest Enhancement: Improved Responsive Image Grid System

### ✅ **NEW IMPROVEMENT: Professional Image Grid Layout - COMPLETED**

**Problem Addressed:**
The user reported that "when browsing this website on mobile the grid is correct and we can see imgs properly but in desktop it's incorrect." The previous Bootstrap grid system was creating too many narrow columns on desktop (4-6 columns) making images appear as awkward vertical "slices."

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Modern CSS Grid System**: Replaced Bootstrap's `col-xl-3` system with a responsive CSS Grid
- **Optimal Desktop Layout**: Maximum 3 columns on desktop for better image showcase
- **Maintained Mobile Perfection**: Preserved the existing perfect 2-column mobile layout
- **Consistent Aspect Ratios**: Replaced fixed heights with proper 3:4 aspect ratios
- **Better Screen Utilization**: Images now properly fill available space on larger screens

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **Enhanced CSS Grid System** with breakpoint-specific column counts:
   - Desktop (1200px+): 3 columns maximum for optimal photography display
   - Medium screens (768-1199px): 3 columns with adjusted spacing
   - Small tablet (577-767px): 2 columns transitional layout
   - Mobile (≤576px): Perfect 2-column layout maintained

2. **Improved Image Styling**:
   - Consistent 3:4 aspect ratio across all screen sizes
   - Removed fixed heights that caused distortion on wide screens
   - Enhanced hover effects and transitions
   - Better spacing with CSS Grid gap instead of Bootstrap padding

3. **Updated All Gallery Pages**:
   - wedding.html, proposal.html, portrait.html, event.html, sport.html
   - Consistent implementation across all gallery sections
   - Maintained lightbox functionality and existing features

**Visual Results:**
- **Before (Desktop)**: 4-6 narrow vertical columns creating poor image presentation
- **After (Desktop)**: 3 well-proportioned columns showcasing images beautifully
- **Mobile**: Maintained the perfect 2-column layout that was already working well

**Testing Results:**
✅ **Desktop Layout**: Professional 3-column grid with proper image proportions
